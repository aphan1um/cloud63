# Twitter Collecting Script
Uses Python and [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) package to gather tweets in real-time by through one's Twitter account.

Needs to be connected with some database so it can be stored. However, incoming tweets might need to be preprocessed before being stored.

## How to use
1. Ensure you have Python installed with the Tweepy package (tested on version 3.7.0). A good way to do this is to create a Python virtual environment and use pip to install Tweepy.

2. Simply run it with Python:
```
python tweetBot.py
```

For assignment 2 of Cluster and Cloud Computing subject *COMP90024*. Main topic was on the sin gluttony. In particular the theme of obesity, and the absence of obesity (i.e. having a healthy diet).

Tweets were collected and compare with official Australian data on obesity & fruit intake statistics to observe correlation between behaviours manifesting from Twitter users and measured statistics.

Project created by team number 63.

## Folder contents
*  *docker*: Contains different components of our system, such as our Twitter harvester and front-end website, which were then turned into Docker images. Each VM instance would then run these images as a part of cluster in Docker Swarm.

*  *ansible*: Files containing our Ansible script to automate deployment of our system, including a functioning website and a Twitter harvester.

Each of those folders have a *README.md* file for more information abouts its contents.
